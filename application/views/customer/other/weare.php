                            <h3>Over 20 years representing Service Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses</h3>
                            <p>Over 20 years ago, a group of veterans who had served their country found themselves struggling as individual business owners. Recognizing the challenges faced by disabled veterans—and grasping the value of teamwork that sets the veteran community apart—they established a network of businesses to serve as advocates and resources for service disabled veteran owned businesses: The Elite Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business Network.</p>

                            <p>A 501(c)19 non-profit veterans organization, the Elite SDVOB Network is an all-volunteer association comprised of business owners. Our mission is centered on advocacy, education and business opportunities advancement for service disabled veteran owned businesses and their allies.</p>

                            <p>A national organization, the Elite SDVOB Network hosts events across the country, including a national convention that has been held annually since 2003. We collaborate with business leaders, policy makers, and the general public to provide the means for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses to overcome challenges and prosper in an evolving business environment.</p>
